### Hello there 👋 beings!

### Planning, deploying, monitoring and managing IT infrastructure with open source tools...
### ...hopefully some "real" coding too.😄  

### - 🔭 I'm currently recreating my homelab from scratch. Whole project will be documented.
### - Configs will be shared as "Infrastructure as Code (IaC)" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code  
### - I'll be going through basic aspects that should be considered when creating IT infrastructure. 
#### - Documentation of all this will be available later on website that I'm also currently building.
#### - I will also create documentation for website creation process.
#### Stay tuned! - /ˈsloʊ.li/
